# rest-cache
A very fast REST cache for WordPress, powered by Laravel. This project is more of a learning exercise for myself, rather than a production plugin, however it should work well. Very good compliment to WP Google Maps and any other plugins which use the REST API.

## Installation
Install through the WordPress plugins menu (when this plugin becomes available there).

Alternatively download the ZIP from this repo (or clone into your plugins folder) and then activate the plugin.
